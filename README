This is a simple iPhone game I made using the cocos2D library. You play as a guy eating a salad with your trainer, and when he's not looking you sneak bites from a burger.

Current version: functional

Features to add:
	-hunger meter to add a time limit
	-levels and gameover screen
	-increase difficulty for each level
	-arms move up and down with touch
	-randomize "looks" more so it's not so predicatble
	-add losing points animation
	-add sounds and music
